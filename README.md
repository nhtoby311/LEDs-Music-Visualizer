# LEDs-Music-Visualizer
----------------------------------------
# Intro
LEDs Music Visualizer system consists of Arduino and Seven Band Graphic Equalizer - MSGEQ7 which able to input the sound, then illustrates the audio spectrum through the LEDs strips. 
## Ingredients
  - Arduino UNO
  - MSGEQ7 
  - 5V Power Supply (â‰¥ 4A)
  - **_Addressable_** LEDs (60LEDs)
## Direction
1. Follow the circuit schematic 
2. The values of capacitors and resistors are based on **_J Skoba_** diagram for MSGEQ7
3.
